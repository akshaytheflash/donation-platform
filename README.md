## Concept:

Building a donation/fundraising platform where we use smart contracts to generate certificates, support crypto, log every transaction on the blockchain and maintain
extreme, complete transparency.

A lot of features including an admin dashboard; monitoring of funds received by the fundraisers is yet to be added.
